           <p>Canary (Serinus canaria)

            Physical Characteristics:
            
            Size: Canaries are petite, with an average length of about 4.5 to 5.5 inches (11 to 14 cm) from beak to tail.
            Color: They are most commonly known for their bright yellow plumage, though they can also be found in shades of green, orange, and even white. Selective breeding has produced a wide range of colors and patterns.
            Bill: They have a small, conical bill well-suited for their diet of seeds.
            Eyes: Their eyes are typically dark and beady, set against a small, rounded head.

            <hr>
            Behavior:
            
            Song: Male canaries are particularly noted for their melodious and varied songs, which they use to attract mates and establish territory. Their singing is a hallmark of their charm and has been a key reason for their popularity as pets.
            Activity: They are lively and social birds, often seen hopping and fluttering around their environment. In the wild, they live in flocks, which helps them find food and evade predators.

            <hr>
            Habitat and Diet:
            
            Habitat: In the wild, canaries inhabit subtropical and tropical forests, scrublands, and grasslands. They prefer areas with dense vegetation and access to water.
            Diet: Their diet primarily consists of seeds, but they also eat fruits, vegetables, and insects in their natural habitat. Pet canaries are usually fed a mix of seeds, supplemented with fruits and vegetables.

            <hr>

            Breeding and Lifespan:
            
            Breeding: Canaries breed easily in captivity. They build cup-shaped nests and lay clutches of 3-6 eggs. The eggs hatch after about two weeks, and the chicks fledge in about three weeks.
            Lifespan: In captivity, canaries can live up to 10-15 years with proper care, though their lifespan in the wild is generally shorter.

            <hr>
        

            Domestication:
            
            Canaries have been domesticated for centuries and are popular pets due to their attractive singing and colorful plumage. They are relatively easy to care for, requiring a spacious cage, a balanced diet, and regular social interaction.

            <hr>

            Conservation Status:
            
            The canary is not currently considered endangered and has a stable population in the wild. However, conservation efforts continue to ensure their habitats remain protected, especially given their popularity in the pet trade.
