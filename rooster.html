        <p>Rooster (Gallus gallus)

            The rooster, also known as a cockerel or cock, is the male of the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the Red Junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Roosters are well-known for their distinctive appearance and behaviors, and they play a prominent role in many agricultural and cultural settings.

            <hr>
            
            Physical Characteristics:<br>

            Size: Roosters are generally larger and heavier than hens (female chickens). They can weigh between 4 to 10 pounds (1.8 to 4.5 kg), depending on the breed.
            <hr>
            
            Feathers: They are renowned for their vibrant plumage, which often includes a mix of bright colors such as red, orange, green, gold, and black. The feathers are usually more elaborate and iridescent compared to those of hens.
            <hr>
            
            Comb and Wattles: Roosters have a prominent comb (a fleshy crest on top of their head) and wattles (fleshy lobes hanging from their neck). These features are often more developed and colorful in roosters, and they play a role in regulating body temperature and attracting mates.
            <hr>
            
            Tail: They possess a distinctive, curved tail with long, elegant feathers that can fan out to display a striking and regal appearance.
            <hr>
            
            Beak and Legs: Roosters have a strong, pointed beak suited for pecking at food. Their legs are sturdy and may have spurs (sharp, bony projections) used for defense and dominance displays.
            <hr>
            
            Behavior:<br>

            Crowing: Roosters are famous for their crowing, especially at dawn, which serves as a way to mark their territory and announce their presence. Crowing can occur at any time of day, and the volume and frequency can vary by individual and breed.
            <hr>
            
            Territorial: Roosters are highly territorial and often establish dominance over other males and their environment. They may engage in displays of aggression and fight to maintain their status.
            <hr>
            
            Protective: Roosters are known for their protective behavior towards their flock. They will often alert hens to potential dangers and will defend them from predators.
            <hr>
            
            Courtship: During the mating season, roosters engage in courtship displays, including puffing out their chest, performing a dance-like movement, and making specific vocalizations to attract hens.
            <hr>
            
            Diet:<br>

            Omnivorous: Roosters have a varied diet that includes grains, seeds, insects, and small animals. In a domestic setting, they are typically fed a balanced poultry feed supplemented with fruits, vegetables, and occasional protein sources.
            <hr>
            Habitat and Environment:<br>

            Natural Habitat: In the wild, roosters (Red Junglefowl) inhabit forests and scrublands, where they roost in trees and forage for food on the ground.
            <hr>
            
            Domestic Setting: In domestic settings, roosters are kept in coops or chicken houses with access to outdoor runs or free-range areas. They require a secure environment to protect them from predators and adequate space to exhibit their natural behaviors.
            <hr>

            Cultural Significance:<br>

            Symbolism: Roosters hold symbolic meanings in various cultures, often representing courage, vigilance, and fertility. They are featured in myths, folklore, and as national symbols in some countries.
            <hr>
            
            Agricultural Role: In agriculture, roosters are valued for their role in breeding and flock management. They help ensure the genetic diversity of the flock and can be used to control the population of hens.
            <hr>
            
            Lifespan:<br>

            Longevity: Roosters typically live 5 to 10 years, depending on their environment and care. In well-managed domestic settings, they can live towards the longer end of this range.
